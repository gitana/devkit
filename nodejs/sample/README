# Hello World (Express)

The purpose of this project is to get a better sense of the CRUD operations that Cloud CMS supports.  We can not
only query for content, but we can also create it, delete it and work with it in result sets.

Jade is used as a templating engine and Express is kept in a pretty minimal configuration.

    a) Create 3 content items
    b) Query for content items and display them
    c) Delete content items

## Setting things up

First, download the gitana.json file for your application or use the cloudcms command line client to initialize a gitana.json
in the local directory.

Then run:

    npm install
    
To run the app:

    npm start
